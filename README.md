# Little Lemon Restaurant React App

The Little Lemon Restaurant project is a React app I built for an assignment as part of my Meta Frontend Developer Certificate. This project was created from scratch.

I followed my design workflow to complete it.

## My Workflow

Here are the steps I take for every project from start to finish:

- **Collect Requirements:** Gather all necessary information and specifications for the project.
- **Research and Generate Ideas:** Explore relevant topics and gather inspiration for the project.
- **Design in Line with Brand:** Create designs that align with the branding and goals of the project.
- **Set Up Project with Tools and Dependencies:** Prepare the project environment, including essential tools and libraries.
- **Develop Frontend from Design:** Build the frontend based on the provided design.
- **Review and Launch:** Assess the quality of the project and deploy it to the production environment.
